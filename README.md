# NES-Synth JS

Very early development. Currently just a little UI and some setup. Sound is not working yet.
It started to get fairly complicated, fairly quickly. Probably need to rewrite/rethink. 
This is intended to be a component of the nes-editor I'm working on. But, I also would like
to make it as stand alone as possible for now. Now with webworker for sequencer clock.

`npm install` or `yarn install`
`npm run dev` or `yarn dev` to start dev server
